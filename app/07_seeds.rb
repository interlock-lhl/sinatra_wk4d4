# Seed data can be found/make from db/seeds.rb
# Often we our app needs some default data to operate, so this is a good place to create
# ActiveRecord code to create that data.

# In our development enviroments, we may want more data so that we can test various features
# of the app. We can use this same seeds to create fake data so we have data to simulate our
# having been used to some extent.
